# ✨ UX POLISH: THE "INVISIBLE" DETAILS

You asked to refine the user experience. We went beyond visuals into **behavioral psychology**.

## 1. The Entrance: Cinematic Zoom Portal
- **The Effect**: When the counter hits 100%, the screen doesn't just fade. It **zooms** into the number.
- **The "Wormhole"**: You fly through the zero digit to reveal the portfolio underneath.
- **Why**: Typically reserved for Awwwards "Site of the Day" winners, this transition sets a hyper-modern tone immediately.

## 2. The Orientation: Active Scroll-Spy
- **What**: The navigation bar now "knows" where you are. As you scroll, the "About" link dims and "Projects" lights up.
- **Why**: Keeps the user grounded in a long scroll experience (Parallax).

## 3. The Friction Remover: Smart Contact
- **What**: The email card is now a giant button. Click it -> "Checkmark" -> Copied to clipboard.
- **Why**: Recruiters hate typing emails manually. We made it zero-friction.

## 4. The Interaction: Feedback Loops
- **Buttons**: All magnetic buttons have hover states.
- **Cursor**: The magnetic cursor "snaps" to interactive elements, confirming "You can click this."
