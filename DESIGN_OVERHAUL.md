# 🎨 DESIGN OVERHAUL: "THE ARCHITECT"

We have moved from a "standard portfolio" to a **decade-defining digital experience**.

## 🛑 What was "Crude"
- Basic grid layouts
- Standard Tailwind colors
- Static scrolling
- Generic component feel

## 🚀 What is now "Advanced"

### 1. **Cinematic Hero Section**
- **Asymmetrical Layout**: Broken grid design for editorial feel.
- **Massive Typography**: "DANIEL ORIAZOWAN" now dominates the screen with a clipped gradient texture.
- **3D Depth**: Your profile image now floats in a glass container with parallax movement.
- **Ambient Lighting**: Background orbs that breathe and move.

### 2. **Parallax Project Gallery**
- **Sticky Stacking**: Projects now stack on top of each other as you scroll (like a deck of cards).
- **Immersive Color**: Each project casts a unique ambient light on the background.
- **Editorial Detail**: High-contrast typography and clear hierarchy.

### 3. **Premium Feel Engine**
- **Lenis Smooth Scroll**: We hijacked the native scrollbar to add weight and momentum.
- **Noise Texture**: A subtle film grain overlays the entire site to prevent "flatness".
- **Glassmorphism 2.0**: Updated glass utilities to be thinner, darker, and more premium.

### 4. **Technical Upgrades**
- **Tailwind v4 Theme**: Completely rewrote the CSS engine to use modern CSS variables.
- **Framer Motion**: Complex scroll-driven animations linked to scroll position.

## 👁️ How to Verify
1.  **Refresh** http://localhost:3000
2.  **Scroll Slowly**: Feel the weight of the scroll.
3.  **Watch the Projects**: Observe how they stack.

**This is no longer a website. It is an experience.**
